Licensing For these open data, the event imagery and data layers will have a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license (CC BY-NC 4.0). The conditions with that license mean that users are free to share, copy and redistribute the data in any medium or format under the following terms:

In the licensing terms, Maxar has a stated exception for OpenStreetMap. OSM is allowed to use imagery released under the Open Data Program. Even though this allows for commercial usage, OSM is a critical platform for the disaster response community. Allowing usage of our imagery in OSM will enable faster data access by local communities as well as global relief efforts.
